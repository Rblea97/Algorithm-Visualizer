# 🔒 Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously for the Algorithm Visualizer project. The following versions are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## Security Context

The Algorithm Visualizer is an **educational desktop application** with the following security characteristics:

### ✅ Low Security Risk Profile
- **No Network Communication**: Application runs entirely offline
- **No Data Collection**: No user data is collected or transmitted
- **No File System Writes**: Only reads its own code and configuration
- **No Elevated Permissions**: Runs with standard user privileges
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for review

### 🛡️ Built-in Security Features
- **Input Validation**: All user input is validated and sanitized
- **Memory Safety**: Uses Python's memory management (no manual memory allocation)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of all user input and edge cases
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library (tkinter)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While the Algorithm Visualizer has a low security risk profile, we take all security concerns seriously.

## Security Best Practices for Users

### 🔐 Safe Usage Guidelines
1. **Download from Official Sources**: Only download from the official GitHub repository
2. **Verify Releases**: Check release signatures and checksums when available
3. **Run with Standard Permissions**: No need to run as administrator/root
4. **Keep Python Updated**: Ensure you're using a supported Python version
5. **Source Code Review**: Feel free to review the open source code

### 🚫 What NOT to Do
- Don't modify core algorithm files unless you understand the implications
- Don't run from untrusted sources or modified versions
- Don't grant unnecessary system permissions to the application

## Security Features Implementation

### 🛡️ Input Validation
```python
# Example of our input validation approach
class InputValidator:
    @staticmethod
    def validate_array_input(input_string: str) -> ValidationResult:
        """
        Comprehensive input validation with security considerations.
        
        - Sanitizes input to prevent injection attacks
        - Validates data types and ranges
        - Limits array size to prevent memory exhaustion
        - Provides safe error handling
        """
        # Implementation includes bounds checking, type validation,
        # size limits, and sanitization
```

### 🔒 Error Handling
```python
# Secure error handling pattern used throughout
try:
    # Potentially risky operation
    result = process_user_input(user_data)
except ValueError as e:
    # Log safely without exposing sensitive information
    logger.warning("Invalid input provided")
    show_user_friendly_error()
except Exception as e:
    # Catch-all for unexpected errors
    logger.error("Unexpected error occurred")
    graceful_degradation()
```

### 🛡️ Resource Management
```python
# Memory and resource management
class ResourceManager:
    def cleanup_resources(self):
        """
        Proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks.
        
        - Cancels pending animations
        - Clears memory references  
        - Closes UI resources properly
        """
        if self.after_id:
            self.root.after_cancel(self.after_id)
        self.callbacks.clear()
        # Additional cleanup
```

## Threat Model
