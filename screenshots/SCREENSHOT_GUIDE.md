   - Ensure window is in focus and fully visible

2. **Timing**
   - Static screenshots: Take immediately after setup
   - Animation screenshots: Click Play, then capture during interesting moments
   - Allow UI to fully render before capturing

3. **File Management**
   - Save as PNG for highest quality
   - Use descriptive filenames
   - Keep originals and create web-optimized versions

4. **Portfolio Use**
   - Lead with the main interface screenshot
   - Show variety with different algorithms
   - Include action shots (animations in progress)
   - Demonstrate both features and visual appeal

### Technical Considerations

- Window size is optimized at 1200x800 for best presentation
- All UI elements are clearly visible and readable
- Professional color scheme showcases technical sophistication
- Clean, modern design appeals to potential employers

### Post-Processing

Consider light post-processing:
- Crop to remove desktop background if desired
- Adjust brightness/contrast for web display
- Compress for web use while maintaining quality
- Create thumbnails for portfolio galleries
